synchronize:
  description: |
    Pull the .deb packages from the upstream based on the config "mirror-list",
    and synchronize the package metadata (index files) with the upstream. In
    addition, unreferenced packages will be automatically cleaned up without
    confirmation; also see check-packages and clean-up-packages actions.
  params:
    source:
      description: |
        Run synchronize for a specific mirror. This parameter is used as a regular
        expression to filter the list of mirrors provided by the "mirror-list"
        configuration option. Leave unset to synchronize all mirrors.
        The following example synchronizes all mirrors starting with
        "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/".
        `juju run-action apt-mirror/0 -- synchronize source="^deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/.*"`

check-packages:
  description: |
    DEPRECATED: Check and report the packages that are no longer referenced in the existing
    snapshots and the mirror path.
    # Note(rgildein): The synchronize action is already cleaning up outed packages from
    mirror path and snapshot are using hard links, so this action should always return empty list.
clean-up-packages:
  description: |
    DEPRECATED: Remove the packages reported in the check-packages action. You must provide
    a parameter 'confirm=true' to actually perform the action; 'confirm=false'
    will abort the action. If you are not sure, please use `check-packages`
    action to view what pacakges can be removed.
    # Note(rgildein): The synchronize action is already cleaning up outed packages from
    mirror path and snapshot are using hard links, so this action should not remove anything.
  params:
    confirm:
      description: "Confirm that you really want to perform this action."
      type: boolean
  required:
    - confirm
